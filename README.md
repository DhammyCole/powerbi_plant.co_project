# Power BI Project: Plant Co. Performance Dashboard

## 📝 Project Overview
This project was developed as a real-world performance tracking solution for Plant Co., a company looking to gain deeper insight into its operational and sales performance across multiple regions and product lines. The primary objective was to design a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that would support business leaders in understanding both high-level trends and granular performance metrics.

The dashboard focused on Year-To-Date (YTD) and Prior Year-To-Date (PYTD) comparisons, enabling quick performance benchmarking and historical analysis. By leveraging Power BI’s data modeling and visualization capabilities, I transformed raw sales data into a dynamic reporting tool that tracks KPIs like Sales, Quantity Sold, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and Gross Profit (GP%).

The dashboard also includes features like drill-through analysis, dynamic titles, and metric switchers — allowing users to explore data across different outlets, timeframes, and product segments. Through this project, I aimed to bridge the gap between data and decision-making, delivering a solution that is both visually intuitive and analytically powerful.
