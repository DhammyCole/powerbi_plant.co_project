# Power BI Project: Plant Co. Performance Dashboard

## 📝 Project Overview
This project was developed as a real-world performance tracking solution for Plant Co., a company looking to gain deeper insight into its operational and sales performance across multiple regions and product lines. The primary objective was to design a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that would support business leaders in understanding both high-level trends and granular performance metrics.

The dashboard focused on Year-To-Date (YTD) and Prior Year-To-Date (PYTD) comparisons, enabling quick performance benchmarking and historical analysis. By leveraging Power BI’s data modeling and visualization capabilities, I transformed raw sales data into a dynamic reporting tool that tracks KPIs like Sales, Quantity Sold, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and Gross Profit (GP%).
The dashboard also includes features like drill-through analysis, dynamic titles, and metric switchers allowing users to explore data across different outlets, timeframes, and product segments. Through this project, I aimed to bridge the gap between data and decision-making, delivering a solution that is both visually intuitive and analytically powerful.

- **Time Intelligence**: YTD and PYTD calculations
- **Switch Logic**: Allows toggling between KPIs
- **Comparisons**: YTD vs PYTD
- **Dynamic Titles**: Context-aware visuals

## 📊 Dashboard Visuals
- **Tree Map**: Bottom 10 countries by YTD vs PYTD
- **Waterfall Chart**: Sales trends by month with drill-through
- **Line & Stacked Column Chart**: Trends by product type and month
- **Scatter Chart**: Profitability segmentation by GP% and sales

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identified low-performing countries
- Visualized product trends over time
- Enabled segmentation of customer accounts

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX

## ✅ Outcome
Delivered a business-ready dashboard that improved visibility and insight for Plant Co., while strengthening my Power BI, DAX, and data modeling skills.
